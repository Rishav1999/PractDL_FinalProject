+ Project summary: The project employs the use of various Deep Learning (Neural Network) models in order to classify Breast Cancer Image appropriately in its two classes of “Non-IDC” and “IDC”. The work proceeds with the Kaggle Breast Histopathology Images, preprocesses it and employs four different neural net models to find out the one that works best. These models were implemented in two different GPU system scenarios: V100 and P100, so that these models can be compared across systems. Our work starts with implementing the VGG16 model, moves on to AlexNet model, and then we create our own model. Finally, we compare all of these models to the method of Transfer Learning using the ResNet50 model. The model that learns best and provides best solution turns out to be the Transfer Learning model with an accuracy close to 85%
